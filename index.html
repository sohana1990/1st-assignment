        <p>Hi, it’s nice to meet you! My name is Salah Uddin. I’m a fine-art photographer based in Khulna, and I’ve been photographing for almost 5 years. I specialize in making portraits of strangers on the street both digitally and with film. Truth is stranger than fiction, and I’ve always been compelled by that fact, especially here in suburb areas. I’m represented by ClampArt, and I exhibit internationally. I’ve been published in The New York Times and my first monograph.I also work as a freelance photography writer for Digital Photo Pro magazine and other industry publications. Right now I’m really passionate about a series of portraits I’m making in my neighborhood. It would be great to stay in touch. Would you like to exchange business cards?</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a photographer raised in Khulna. I have some sharp and breathtaking images of animals, people and more. There are a lot of black and whites for a classic yet loud vibe. I used to be a painter also. But these days doing photography gives me immense satisfaction.</p>
